## 🏁 How It Works (End-to-End)

1. User uploads financial documents (PDF, images, CSVs)  
2. **Agent #1** extracts a clean structured JSON  
3. **Agent #2** uses JSON to provide tax optimization  
4. **Agent #3** performs compliance checks  
5. The Lovable app merges all outputs into a final report  

This workflow runs entirely on Google AI Studio + Lovable without any backend server.
